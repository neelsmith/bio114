# Testing your skills

No background of any kind, or previous experience with coding is needed for this course: we'll learn that together in class.

You do have to be familiar with the computer you'll be using.  Before coming to our first hands-on session, you should pass these two tests:


## Managing files

1. Download a file (TEST LINK TBA)
2. Find it on your computer
3. Open it in VS Code
4. --> ADD HERE WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE


## Managing Pluto

1. Open a Julia REPL
2. Start Pluto: `using Pluto; Pluto.run()`
3. When your web browser opens a "Welcome to Pluto.jl" page, paste this URL into the "Open a notebook" box (TEST LINK TBA)
4. --> ADD HERE WHAT YOU SHOULD SEE
