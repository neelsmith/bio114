# Linguistic evolution

How does language evolve?


## Data model

In this exercise, we will use a very minimal data model of language: we will compare individual vocabulary items with similar meaning in different languages, and try to construct an evolutionary tree based on the words' sound structure (their *phonology*).

## Ways this model fails

- We take no account of how words change forms to express different ideas (their *morphology*), such as the different forms of singular and plural nouns in English.  
- We take no account of how words are composed or arranged to express meaning (their *syntax*).

## Homework

1. For any language other than English that you speak or have studied, please create a simple two-column table providing a comparable or equivalent term for each English word in the list below. If you have familiarity with more than one language other than English, feel free to include as many columns as you like in the table!
2. Look at the *sound patterns* in the two lists (English and your chosen language).  Do you see any consistent or systematic patterns?  If you're having trouble with this, focus on the initial sounds of words in each language.  Summarize your observations in a brief paragraph.
3. How would you explain any systematic patterns you identified in step 2?  Can you suggest a cause or mechanism of change?  More than one possible cause or mechanism of change?

Please submit a pdf with your written responses to each of the three preceding questions.
