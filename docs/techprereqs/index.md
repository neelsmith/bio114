# Technical prerequisites

There are only two prerequisites for the exercises on this site:

1. the [Julia language](https://julialang.org/downloads/).  Download and install the current stable release.
2. [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download). Download and install the current version for your OS. 

If you're on Mac OS, open VS Code, open the Command Palette (`Cmd+Shift+P`) and start typing 'shell command'.  When you see a listing like this !()[https://code.visualstudio.com/assets/docs/setup/mac/shell-command.png], choose `Install 'code' command in PATH`.


One theme of our work will be that we don't do computational work without designing a way to test, so 

We will devote one class session to [testing that your personal machine is ready to go](../tuneup/) for all of our hands-on exercises.
