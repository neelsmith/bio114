# Collections of data

In this session, we learn basic manipulations of collections of data: how to walk through every element of a collection using a `for` loop, how to select elements from a collection with the `filter` function, and how to transform every element of a collection using the `map` function.

Everything we cover is summarized in a Pluto notebook you can [view here](../../notebooks/collections.jl.html). The notebook includes a couple of more challenging self tests you can try out. To run the notebook interactively, use the button at the top right of the page  ![**Edit** or **run** this notebook](../../imgs/edit-run.png)
