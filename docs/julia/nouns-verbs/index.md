# Nouns and verbs of the Julia language

We introduce the "nouns" and "verbs" of the Julia language in class -- *objects* and *functions*, in technical terms.

Everything we covered in class is summarized in a Pluto notebook you can [view here](../../notebooks/basics.jl.html).  


The notebook also includes a couple of self tests you can try out.  To run the notebook interactively, can use the button at the top right of the page  ![**Edit** or **run** this notebook](../../imgs/edit-run.png) and follow the instructions for using the notebook in Pluto.
